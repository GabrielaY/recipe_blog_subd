### How to run project

Install `pipenv` on your local machine. If there are any problems contact me for help. Pull the latest changes.
Then type in the following commands:

```
$ pipenv install -> installs all dependencies for the project
$ pipenv shell -> creates the virtual environment with all the installed dependencies
$ flask run -> run the application
```

When you are done with writing code, type:
```
$ exit -> to exit from the virtual environment
```

For any questions on virtual environments, contact me so I can explain them more in debt.
